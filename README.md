Documentation of our private API is found below.


### Endpoints
**Base URL:** api.hackcheck.io
* /api/v2/lookup - Perform query searches 

### Authentication
Our private API is only accessible to those who purchase a _developer_ plan at [hackcheck.io](https://hackcheck.io)

To authenticate a request on our API you need the following
- API Key
- Whitelisted IP Address

If you are having trouble authenticating your IP address, visit [here](https://api.hackcheck.io/api/v2/ip) and make sure the IP you are entering on your [profile](https://hackcheck.io/profile) matches the IP you are shown.


Once you've purchase a developer plan you can navigate to your [profile](https://hackcheck.io/profile), there you will be able to copy your `API key` and authorize whichever IP address you'd like.

### /api/v2/lookup
This endpoint is used to perform various queries against our database to get the information you're looking for.

We currently limit responses to a maximum of 15,000 results, this is to ensure request time is reasonable and to prevent abuse.

#### Queires
Hackcheck currently offers six  queires.
- Email Address `email`
- Username      `username`
- Password      `password`
- IP Address    `ip`
- Phone Number  `phone`
- Domain Name   `domain`

Keep in mind that some plans cannot use all of these queries. 

### Response Handling
Our API consists of two response bodies.
#### Valid Response
```
{
    "found": 0,
    "results": [],
    "elapsed": "1ms",
    "success": true
}
```
#### Error Response
```
{
    "message": "error message",
    "success": false
}
```
These two body structures make it easy for developers to parse our responses with efficiency and ease. 

#### Breakdown
`found` - INT that represents the number of results that were found for your query.

`results` - Array that contains all of the results found.

`elapsed` - String that represents the milliseconds it took our server to return results for your query.

`success` - Boolean that represents if the API request was successful or if it failed.

`message` - String that contains a message, this element is only returned if success is false.

### Regex

Our API provides Regex support to help you find what you're looking.

`*` - Represents zero or more characters.

`_` - Represents a single character.

If you want to use regex you need to enable the `regex` parameter like as seen below.

`https://api.hackcheck.io/api/v2/lookup?key=0000000000000000000000&regex=true&email=example_@gmail.com`

#### Examples
   
`Query:` example*@gmail.com

`Response:` example@gmail.com, exampletexts@gmail.com, examplesalad@gmail.com, etc


`Query:` example_@gmail.com

`Response:` examples@gmail.com, example1@gmail.com, example2@gmail.com, etc

---
### Rate Limits

A rate limit is the allowed requests per second someone is allowed to send requests & receive a response to our API. The rate limit you receive depends on the plan you purchase.

If you want to have insight on your current rate limit you can use the following headers.

```hc-allowed-rate``` - This number represents the requests per second you are allowed to send using the current API key.

```hc-current-rate``` - This number represents the numbers of requests you've send in the last second.
