# Where does all of this data come from?
All the data we return is collected from a broad range of sources. These sources include forums, dark parts of the internet, and security researchers. Our team constantly keeps an eye out for new breaches.

# What payment methods do you accept?
We currently accept many cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai. We plan to expand our payment methods in the future to include options such as credit and debit cards integrated with Stripe and PayPal.

# What's the difference between HackCheck and other similar services?
One major difference is that we offer our API. The HackCheck API has been specifically designed by developers, for developers. It's never been so easy to parse the response returned. Our API also offers low rate-limit to allow for you to work fast and efficiently.

# Am I able to download these databases from your service?
We do not provide any feature to download databases, neither do we plan to.

# Is this service legal?
When a website has a data breach, many times the data usually ends up getting leaked into the public, therefore being considered public domain. All information provided by HackCheck is all publically owned, therefore being considered fully legal to use. As a user of our services, you are still required to follow our [Terms of Services](https://hackcheck.io/TOS).
